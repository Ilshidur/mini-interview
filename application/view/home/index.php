    <h2>You are in the View: application/view/home/index.php (everything in the box comes from this file)</h2>
    <p>In a real application this could be the homepage.</p>

    <h2>Problems to solve :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Solve the bug that blocks songs addition or deletion</li>
        <li>Prevent the songs list from XSS vulnerabilities</li>
        <li>
            Add a new subpage named "FizzBuzz" :
            <ul>
                <li>showing the songs filtered by their artist name</li>
                <li>shows the song ID but :</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>if the ID is divisible by 3, show the word "fizz" instead</li>
                    <li>if the ID is divisible by 5, show the word "buzz" instead</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            (the way the songs are shown doesn't matter)
        </li>
    </ul>
